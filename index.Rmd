# Preface {-}

This book emerged from the course notes I developed as instructor for a course (STAT 341) at Colorado State University. My intent is for this to serve as a resource for an introductory-level undergraduate course on regression methods. Emphasis is on the application of methods, and so mathematical concepts are intertwined with examples using the R computing language. 

This book assumes an understanding of basic statistical concepts, including expectation and variance. The examples almost exclusively use the R programming language, and basic familiarity with R is assumed.
