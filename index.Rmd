# Foreword

This book emerged from the course notes I developed as instructor for a course (STAT 341) at Colorado State University. My intent is for this to serve as a resource for an introductory-level course on regression methods. The emphasis is on application and interpretation as much as the mathematical details.
 This book assumes an understanding of basic statistical concepts, including expectation and variance. The examples almost exclusively use the R programming language, and basic familiarity with R is assumed.
